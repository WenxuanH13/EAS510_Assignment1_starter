# EAS 510 - Assignment 1: Digital Forensics Apprentice

A rule-based expert system that matches modified images back to their originals.

This is the **starter repository** for Project 1. Two repositories matter:

| Repository | Role |
|------------|------|
| `delveccj/EAS510_Assignment1_starter` (this repo) | Your **code** lives here. You will fork it, work in your fork, and push your final submission here. |
| `delveccj/EAS510_Assignment1` | The **dataset** (read-only). Clone it for the images; never commit it to your fork. |

## Setup on your Codio box

```bash
# 1. Fork this repo on GitHub, then in your box:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/EAS510_Assignment1_starter.git
cd EAS510_Assignment1_starter

# 2. Clone the read-only dataset as a sibling folder (images live there):
cd ~/workspace
git clone https://github.com/delveccj/EAS510_Assignment1.git

# 3. Install dependencies:
cd ~/workspace/EAS510_Assignment1_starter
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Point this box at YOUR fork (run once):
./setup_git.sh
```

## Repository layout

```
forensics_detective.py   SimpleDetector: register targets + find_best_match
rules.py                 Rule functions (Rule 1: Metadata, Rule 2: Histogram, Rule 3: Template)
test_system.py           Runs the detector over the data folders and writes results_*.txt
scripts/check_output_format.py   Validates a results file against the required format
setup_git.sh, submit.sh  One-time setup + commit/push helper ("backup button")
```

## The task in one paragraph

Implement three interpretable rules (metadata, color histogram, template matching)
that combine into a 0-100 confidence score. Run your system on `modified_images/`
and `random/` and save the full output as `results_v1.txt`. In Phase 2, run on
`hard/`, diagnose a systematic failure, add a **Rule 4**, and save
`results_v1_hard.txt` and `results_v2.txt`. Full instructions are in the Codio guide
and in the assignment PDF in UBLearns.

## Running

```bash
# Phase 1 (easy + random) -> results_v1.txt
python3 test_system.py --modified --random --output results_v1.txt

# Phase 1 on hard cases -> results_v1_hard.txt
python3 test_system.py --hard --output results_v1_hard.txt

# Phase 2 (everything) -> results_v2.txt
python3 test_system.py --modified --hard --random --output results_v2.txt

# Validate any results file against the required format:
python3 scripts/check_output_format.py results_v1.txt
```

The data folders are resolved from a sibling clone of `EAS510_Assignment1`.
If your data is elsewhere, pass `--data-dir /path/to/EAS510_Assignment1`.

## Output format (do not alter)

```
Processing: modified_image_01.jpg
Rule 1 (Metadata): FIRED - Size ratio 0.85 -> 20/30 points
Rule 2 (Histogram): FIRED - Correlation 0.92 -> 25/30 points
Rule 3 (Template): FIRED - Match score 0.76 -> 30/40 points
Final Score: 75/100 -> MATCH to original_03.jpg
```


## Observed weakness in V1: what failed and why
Much of the weakness in V1 were due to the lack of reuslts in rule 3. 
Many of the images that were rejected were because of a low score in rule 3. 
This may be because of rule 3 only comparing the grayscale images and not much else 
about it.

## Design decision for V2: what Rule 4 is and why you chose it
I chose Canny edge comparison because I think that comparing the edges 
would lead to more precision between the images, and because the images that 
rule 3 did not fired on were mostly cropped images, comparing the edges between 
the images, I think, would lead to more precision.

## Effect of the change: accuracy before/after on easy vs hard
Accuracy before on Easy was 41 matched and 34 missed, on easy after rule 4, 
was 41 matched and 34 missed. Accuracy on hard before was 38 hit and 22 misses, 
and after rule 4 was 34 hits and 26 misses. 

## Trade-offs: what new costs or risks did Rule 4 introduce
Because of the addition of a rule 4, we need to tune rule 4 to be a good rule for it 
to be effective and if it's not tuned enough, it would actually lead to a decrease 
in effectiveness because it weigh down the accuracy by removing some of the effectiveness 
of rule 1 and 2 by lowering the maximum score of them. Because of that rule 1 and 2, 
were given less of a saying in the matching of images. 







## Backup doctrine

Your Codio box can be reset at any time. **Your fork on GitHub is the only safe
copy.** After every milestone run `./submit.sh "describe what you did"`. A box
restart never touches GitHub.
